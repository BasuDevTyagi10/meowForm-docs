# MeowForms

it allows you to build forms quite easy and fast without any backend instantly so you can foucs on what really matters :)

You just need to make a post resquest to the meowForms servers , ones you have registered that's it no hard more hard task or something :)

```js

<Form action="https://server.meowform.xyz/page/YourEmail method="post" />

```

currently you can submit your response in two ways .

if you are using just html just submit your response here

```
https://server.meowform.xyz/page/[your Email]l&[formName]

```

- if you are using a frontend framework then you need to send a post request to

```html
https://server.meowform.xyz/form/[Email]&[FormName]
```

- if you are not ready for that simply add form action to https://server.meowform.xyz/page/YourEmail in your code that would work like a charm.

```html
<Form action="https://server.meowform.xyz/page/YourEmail method="post" />
```

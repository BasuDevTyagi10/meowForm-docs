# making form

firstly , make sure you have registred your email in meowforms :)

now we would be creating a form

```html
<form
  action="https://server.meowform.xyz/page/gauravtewari111@gmail.com&webClass"
  name="form"
  class="formBody"
  method="POST"
>
  <input type="text" placeholder="name" name="name" required />
  <input type="email" placeholder="email" name="email" required />
  <input type="text" placeholder="roll no" name="roll no" required />
  <input type="text" placeholder="section" name="section" required />
  <button name="submit" type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

just remember you have added the url of the meowform's server correctly :) and do remember to add a name to the input other wise it would be reflected in the code email and your dashboard :(

Using meow form is that easy :)
